## About me
My name is Carsten Wulff and I'm an analog integrated circuit designer, programmer, educator and group
manager.

I have three axis in relation to analog integrated circuit design:

- I work at [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com), where I run the Wireless group that make most
  of the analog and RF designs for Nordic's short-range products
- I work at [NTNU](https://ntnu.no) where I teach [Advanced Integrated
  Circuits](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TFE4188#tab=omEmnet)
- I have a hobby trying to figure out how to make a new analog circuit design
  paradigm. The one we have today with
  schematic/simulation/layout/verification/simulation is too slow
